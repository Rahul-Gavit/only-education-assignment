## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <your-project-name>
    ```

2.  **Install server dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install #or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Configure MongoDB:**

    - Ensure MongoDB is running.
    - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

      ```
      MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
      PORT=5000 #or whatever port you want the server to run on.
      ```

    - If using MongoDB Atlas, replace `mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name` with your Atlas connection string.

4.  **Install client dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install #or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```

5.  **Configure client environment variables (if needed):**

    - Create a `.env.local` file in the `client` directory if you have client specific environment variables. For example, if your backend server is running on a different port than the default, or if you have an API key.
    - Example `.env.local`:

      ```
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
      ```

      - Note the NEXT*PUBLIC* prefix. It is necessary for environment variables to be accessible within the nextJS browser environment.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    cd ../server
    npm run start # or yarn start or pnpm start
    ```

    - Or if you have nodemon installed and configured in your package.json scripts:

      ```bash
      npm run dev # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
      ```

2.  **Start the Next.js development server:**

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm run dev # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
    ```

    - The Next.js application should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

1.  **Build the Next.js application:**

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm run build #or yarn build or pnpm build
    ```

    - This will create a `.next` directory containing the optimized production build of your Next.js application.

2.  **Start the Next.js production server:**

    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm run start #or yarn start or pnpm start
    ```

    - The Next.js application will now be served from the server's port.

3.  **Serve the backend server:**
    - The backend server must be running for the frontend to work correctly. The next build command only builds the frontend. It does not package the backend.
    - For production, both the server and the next.js build must be available.

## Deployment

- Deploy your backend server to a hosting platform like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.
- Deploy your Next.js application to a hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify.
- Ensure that your client-side environment variables point to the production server.
- Configure any necessary environment variables on your hosting platforms.

## Notes

- Replace `<your-project-name>` and `<your-database-name>` with your actual project and database names.
- Adjust the port numbers and paths as needed.
- This README provides a basic setup. You may need to add additional steps based on your project's specific requirements.
- Remember to add your `node_modules` and `.next` folders to your `.gitignore` file.
- Next.js handles static file serving automatically from the `public` directory.
- When using next.js, the server side code is generally for API endpoints.
